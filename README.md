My implementation of the Advanced Forms project from The Odin Project:

http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms

Creates the first three steps of the checkout process for booking a one-way flight.

This project requires

- setting up a database and create associations, then populating that data base.
- creating forms such as dropdowns and date pickers
- querying database
- rendering forms based on user input
